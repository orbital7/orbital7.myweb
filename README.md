MyWeb uses the following services:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/">Microsoft Azure's Blob Storage</a> to store your favorite websites list and associated thumbnails.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thum.io">Thum.io</a> to generate the website thumbnails. Thum.io allows you to generate 1000 thumbnails per month for free; if you require more, you can sign up for a paid account.
</ul>

MyWeb is built on top of Orbital7's RapidApp framework.
